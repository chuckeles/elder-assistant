2. Make and commit your changes.
3. Push the branch.
4. Create a new pull request here on Github.
5. Wait for someone to approve (maybe disable...).

## Technologies

Let's keep this simple and frontend-only. The site will be hosted right here on Github. We'll use simple HTML, CSS, and JS. Jekyll will also help to process the files, check its docs.
