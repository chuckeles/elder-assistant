When you are making new changes, create a separate branch for it. Let's say you are making the about page. So you create a new branch called `about-page`. You make your changes and commit them to this branch. When you're done, push your changes and create a new pull request. In this instance, it would be a PR called `Add about page`. Wait for someone from the team to approve your changes. After they approve your changes, you can merge them.

Keep the changes and PRs small. The smaller they are, the better the chance that you won't have any merge conflicts with other team members.
