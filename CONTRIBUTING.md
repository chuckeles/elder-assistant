When you are making new changes, create a separate branch for it. Let's say you are making the about page. So you create a new branch called `about-page`. You make your changes and commit them to this branch. When you're done, push your changes and create a new pull request. In this instance, it would be a PR called `Add about page`. Wait for someone to from the team approve your changes. After they approve your changes, you can merge them.
